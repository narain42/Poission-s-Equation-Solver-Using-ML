The state of the art Poission's equation solver using Machine Learning methods have been reviewed. A new scheme is implemented where boundary conditions are used in the loss function. The new method gives comparable solution to existing methods. It is easy to use and fairly accurate.
The ref 3 (github/Tam) should be (imyoungmin/DENN) by Luis Angel.
